     * * `healthchecks.passive.type` - (Optional) is a passive health check type. Interpreting HTTP/HTTPS statuses, or just check for TCP connection success. Possible values are `tcp`, `http` or `https` (in passive checks, `http` and `https` options are equivalent.). Defaults to `http`.
     * * `healthchecks.passive.healthy.successes` - (Optional) is a Number of successes in proxied traffic (as defined by `healthchecks.passive.healthy.http_statuses`) to consider a target healthy, as observed by passive health checks. Defaults to `0`.
     * * `healthchecks.passive.healthy.http_statuses` - (Optional) is an array of HTTP statuses which represent healthiness when produced by proxied traffic, as observed by passive health checks.
