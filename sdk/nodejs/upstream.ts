     * * `healthchecks.passive.healthy.successes` - (Optional) is a Number of successes in proxied traffic (as defined by `healthchecks.passive.healthy.http_statuses`) to consider a target healthy, as observed by passive health checks. Defaults to `0`.
     * * `healthchecks.passive.healthy.http_statuses` - (Optional) is an array of HTTP statuses which represent healthiness when produced by proxied traffic, as observed by passive health checks.
